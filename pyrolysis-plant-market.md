<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pyrolysis Plant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Batch Type</li><li>Semi-Continuous Type</li><li>Fully Continuous Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pyrolysis plant market is segmented into three main types: batch type, semi-continuous type, and fully continuous type. Batch type plants process raw materials in discrete batches, offering flexibility but lower efficiency. Semi-continuous plants combine aspects of both, allowing for some continuous material feeding while still utilizing batch processing for efficiency. Fully continuous plants operate seamlessly without interruption, maximizing output and efficiency, making them ideal for large-scale operations. Each type caters to different production needs and operational scales.</p></p>
