<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pilot Headsets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PNR headsets</li><li>ANR headsets</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pilot headset market is primarily divided into two types: Passive Noise Reduction (PNR) and Active Noise Reduction (ANR) headsets. PNR headsets utilize sound-dampening materials to physically block external noise, providing basic noise attenuation. In contrast, ANR headsets employ sophisticated electronics to actively cancel ambient noise by producing opposing sound waves. While PNR headsets are generally more affordable and simpler, ANR models offer superior noise control, making them increasingly preferred among pilots for enhanced comfort and clarity during flight.</p></p>
