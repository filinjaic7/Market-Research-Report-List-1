<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PET Bottle Recycling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemical</li><li>Mechanical</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PET bottle recycling market encompasses two primary types: mechanical and chemical recycling. Mechanical recycling involves shredding and washing used PET bottles to create recycled pellets, which can be used in new products. This method is generally less expensive but may degrade the material quality over time. In contrast, chemical recycling processes PET bottles back into their original monomers, allowing for a higher-quality material that can be reused indefinitely. Both methods contribute to sustainability but cater to different industry needs.</p></p>
